# Testing jupyterlab_geojs

Tests are written for both kernel side (python) and client (javascript) code.
To the extent practical:
* Python tests generate data-model files.
* Data-model files are validated using the model.schema.json file in the models folder.
* Javascript tests are written to read the data-model files generated by the python tests.

To run all tests, use this order

```
npm run schema        # updates model.schema.json
python -m unittest    # tests python code, producing and validating data-model files
npm run test          # tests javascript code, using the data-model files
```
